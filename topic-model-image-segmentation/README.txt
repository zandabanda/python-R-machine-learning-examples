For problem 1, execute the code up to the while loop for initialization; the while loop is the EM algorithm.  PROBLEM 1 is in the R file.

NOTE: It takes 2+ hours to run fully


PROBLEM 2 is a .py file.  

The code in  the .py file needs to be interpreted with Python 2.7.1. It also imports numpy, os, and cv2, so those packages would need to be in the appropriate directories. The number of segments can be set on line 10. The working directory where the images are stored can be set on line 32. Also, the image can be chosen on lines 34-40.
