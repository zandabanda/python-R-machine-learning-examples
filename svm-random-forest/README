1) Move to directory containing all data and make sure all the relevant packages are installed as listed in the script.


**NOTE: PLEASE USE the GIVEN file “pubfig_attributes.csv”, the CSV file, not the plain text. It needs to be unzipped!!!!!! **


2) Run each section in succession; the sections are labeled with comments ('Read in Data', 'Part A, Linear SVM', ...)

3) If you encounter a block of code enclosed in an IF statement 'if(FALSE)', DO NOT run that block; it did not contribute to results.

3) For Part A using 'svmlight', change the path in the svmlight function call to the correct path containing the svmlight package.

4) For Part C, the classifier used is the Random Forest model built for validation set #1, 'rf_val1'.
