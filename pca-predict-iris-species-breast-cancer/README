The packages "lattice", "plsdepot", and "rgl" are necessary to execute this code. They can be installed and loaded by lines 1-8.

It is assumed that the data files "iris.data", "wine.data", and "wdbc.data" are in the working directory. Their location should be specified on line 9.

The comments point to the code associated with producing the graph for each part (eg. the comment on line 64 shows that lines 65-66 produce the graph for part 5c).
However, parts may not be independent of others (eg 5c uses "pca" which is instantiated on line 41 in part 5a).

Running the entire file should work and produce all the plots. Creating a new plot will close the last though. 
To see all the graphs, the code could be run part-by-part in-order.
Alternatively, the line "dev.new()" could be added after each call to draw a graph. In this situation, run the code all at once.
